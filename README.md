# RainyDays

Rainy Days is a website that sells Jakcets.

This is one of my first real coding projects in html and CSS.

I have learned alot in this project but i still feel like i can learn alot more and make better websites wehn i start with JS aswell. I have also learned alot on how to work on a website from the start. So the next time i make a website i will know a better pipeline for working on the website. But i am pretty happy about having very little validation errors when i checked, and have fixed alot of it.
