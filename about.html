        <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
            Founded in 2023, Rainy Days was born out of a love for adventure and a 
            desire to conquer the elements without sacrificing style. Our founder, 
            [Founder's Name], embarked on a hiking trip through the rugged landscapes of [Location],
            where unpredictable weather changes inspired the creation of Rainy Days.
            We realized that staying comfortable in the great outdoors doesn't mean compromising on aesthetics.
            Thus, Rainy Days was established to bridge the gap between fashion and functionality.
